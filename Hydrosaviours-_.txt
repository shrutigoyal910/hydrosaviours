About the project:
Water as a resource is critical to our very survival. The importance of water cannot be overstated and we are recklessly wasting our precious resource. We are getting more 
amount of water in our houses than we need and without thinking we are  wasting  it. With the increasing scarcity of usable water, it is sincerely needed to make sure that the 
water is used wisely. This project aims to minimise the excess wastage of water which happens daily in our households by supplying only the amount of water which is
 required.


Our project:
In this project we made a website that will tell us the amount of water which is required by a particular household . People can also request for extra amount of water if 
required. We  control the amount of water supplied to every household by water flow sensor and microcontroller.
